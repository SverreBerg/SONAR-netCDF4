This directory contains the text and source files necessary to generate the https://github.com/ices-eg/wg_WGFAST/blob/master/SONAR-netCDF4/README.adoc[SONAR-netCDF4 convention document]. It is also the place where new versions of the convention are discussed and developed.

Version 1.0 of the SONAR-netCDF4 convention (as ICES CRR No. 341) is available http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Cooperative%20Research%20Report%20(CRR)/CRR341.pdf[here].


== Suggestions and contributions welcome
WGFAST welcomes suggestions, discussion, and contributions to this SONAR netCDF-4 convention.

Before submitting a pull request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits within the scope and aims of the convention, and whether your idea can be achieved within the existing SONAR netCDF-4 convention. It is your role to adequately explain and justify the merits of what you want. Please provide as much detail and context as possible. Good pull requests remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

*Please ask the convention coordinators before starting on any _significant_ edits*. Otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the convention coordinators might not want to merge into the project.
