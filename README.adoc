= The SONAR-netCDF4 convention for sonar data

This directory contains the text, source files, and utilities that are necessary to generate the SONAR-netCDF4 convention document. It is also the place where new versions of the convention are discussed and developed.

Version 1.0 of the SONAR-netCDF4 convention (as ICES CRR No. 341) is available http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Cooperative%20Research%20Report%20(CRR)/CRR341.pdf[here].

== Contributing to this convention

WGFAST welcomes suggestions, discussion, and contributions to this sonar data convention.
Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the process easy and effective for everyone involved.

The convention is stored in the AsciiDoc markup language and stored on this github repository. Suggestions, discussions and contributions are done through the facilities provided by github - use the issue tracker for suggestions and discussions. Create pull requests for contributions.

Enhancement requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the convention and whether your idea can be achieved within the existing convention. It is your role to adequately explain and justify the merits of what you want. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

Good pull requests - corrections, improvements, etc are a great help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

*Please ask first* before starting on any significant pull request,
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
convention's coordinators might not want to merge into the project.

=== AsciiDoc tools

Contributors to this convention may not be familiar with Git, GitHub, and AsciiDoc, so we provide here some starting points and suggestions.

==== Git & GitHub

Git is a version control system used to manage and keep track of edits while GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service used to manages Git repositories. wg_WGFAST is a repository within the https://github.com/ices-eg[ICES Expert Groups] workspace.

If you wish to edit the document, fork the repository, clone it locally (or edit the forked version online), commit your changes, then create a pull request. There are plenty of Git and https://guides.github.com/[GitHub tutorials] and explanations online to help you with this.

The https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/[Sourcetree] program for Windows and Mac is a useful tool for working with Git repositories. https://tortoisehg.bitbucket.io/[TortoiseHg] for Windows and Linux is another option. You can of course also use the Git command line interface.

==== Real-time rendering of the document

When editing the convention file, it is useful to see the rendered version of the document as changes are made. Ways to achieve this are explained https://asciidoctor.org/docs/editing-asciidoc-with-live-preview/[here]. We find that
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-browser-extension[Asciidoctor.js Live Preview] works well, but note that it does not currently do the bibliography in the AcMeta document.

==== Off-line rendering of the document

This requires installing AsciiDoctor onto your computer and can be somewhat complicated. Instructions are https://asciidoctor.org/docs/install-toolchain/[here]. Remember to also install the asciidoctor-bibtex extension. Once all installed, the convention can be rendered in several formats with these commands.

HTML files:: Generates one or more files (images are kept separate):

 asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-bibtex acmeta.adoc

HTML (single file):: For a single html file (including the images, which makes it easier to distribute):

 asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-bibtex --backend html5 -a data-uri acmeta.adoc

PDF:: Note that the asciidoctor-mathematical extension must be installed to get the mathematical equations correctly rendered:

 asciidoctor-pdf -r asciidoctor-bibtex  acmeta.adoc

Word (.docx):: First convert to docbook format, then install and use https://pandoc.org/[pandoc] to convert to Word:

 asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-bibtex --backend docbook acmeta.adoc
 pandoc --from docbook --to docx -o acmeta.docx acmeta.xml
